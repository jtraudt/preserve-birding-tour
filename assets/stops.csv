1,Class of 1918 Marsh,43.083704,-89.42969,"The Class of 1918 Marsh is a just small remnant of what used to be a large wetland area now consists of playing fields and parking lots. Since the early 1970s, efforts to restore this marsh and wetland area have been at play. Today, a lot of waterfowls can be found at this marsh. Look out for Sandhill Cranes, shorebirds, ducks, and geese, spring, summer, and fall.",Begin your tour near the Class of 1918 Marsh,IMG_8883.png
2,Bill's Woods,43.085604,-89.429966,"This rectangle-shaped land of woods lies between University Bay Drive and the Eagle Heights Community Gardens. Parts of these woods were an established woodland prior to 1930, when it was cleared and grazed as it was turned into farm land. Later becoming an area used for agricultural research and campus landscaping operations storage, the old growth forest was threatened. Today, Bill's Woods consists of nearly 50 years of forest regrowth. Birds are abundant in this spot as non-native species are removed and native forests are restored. Additionally many spring ephemerals and native plants and flowers attract birds for their fruit and seeds. Look out for the pair of Barred Owls that currently live in Bill's Woods year-round as they are a non-migratory species.",Go through the Picnic Point entrance and swing a left,IMG_1719.png
3,Biocore Prairie,43.088408,-89.429093,"Biocore prairie is used by UW-Madison students in a four semester lab-intensive honors sequence to research and restore a previously agricultural field to native tallgrass prairie. There are many bird species that prefer prairies for nesting and prey. Look out for Tree Swallow (image above), Purple Martin, Song Sparrow, and Brown-headed Cowbird before they migrate south for the winter months and return in early spring. American Goldfinch also frequent the prairie and can be seen or heard year-round here.",Look to the left for the prairie!,IMG_1371.png
4,Caretaker's Woods,43.089116,-89.428338,"Caretaker's Woods are an 8-acre triangular patch of forest that resides directly east of Biocore Prairie. This land slopes down to Lake Mendota giving it a north-facing aspect that results in less indirect sunlight. This creates moist, cool soil that supports a diversely-aged mesic forest of red oaks, maples, basswoods, and slippery elms. This is a unique spot where you can look out for waterfowls such as American Coots (coot float depicted above) on Lake Mendota and a Green Heron on land. Some American Coots are year-round residents through winter in Southern Wisconsin, expecially if there is open water. Similarly, some Green Herons will stick around through the winter.",,IMG_3306.png
5,Second Point Woods,43.090514,-89.429177,"Second Point Woods is located  southeast of Frautschi point and northwest of Caretaker's Woods. These woods get their name for being named after Picnic Point. This area was originally cleared to be an agricultural field, which has been undergoing regrowth of woody vegetation since 1989 when the Fratschi family purchased this land and donated it to UW-Madison. Look out for diving ducks and Tundra Swan on Lake Mendota. Diving duck abundance and diversity is best in late fall until the water freezes.",,IMG_1974.png
6,Frautschi Point,43.092682,-89.430985,"Frautschi Point is the northernmost parcel in the Preserve along Lake Mendota. Forest consists of mixed-deciduous and conifers. This land was gifted to the University in the late 1980s by the Frautschi family which led to the creation of the Lakeshore Nature Preserve. This point is a good birding location year round, however fall is particularly incredible as migration is underway many birds headed south break here to refuel on their journey.",Look out for an old fireplace that was built for a family cottage in the 1920s,IMG_1969.png
